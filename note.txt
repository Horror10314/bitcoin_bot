- fully observable environment

=== algorithm based taxonomy ===
- on policy (maybe good to have improved rl) / off policy (maybe find new good way)
- probably model-free / I could create a very simple model
- temporal difference update
- value based, policy based, actor critic
- not sure fore DRL
- online RL (highly probably)
